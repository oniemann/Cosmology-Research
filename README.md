# Cosmology-Research

dissect.py: Interprets Bolshoi-Planck data and parses it into 21 quadrants for easier computing.

find_targets.py: Further parses the 21 quadrants into ~1000 systems which will be used for further analysis.

newbound.py: Takes ~1000 systems and runs energy calculations on them, producing multiple figures for each.

shift_target.py: Consistency check for calculations carried out in newbound.py

get_statistics.ipynb: Further quantitative analysis on the results of newbound.py, in attempts to find trends in
                      thousands of identified systems.
